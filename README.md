# Madden Fantasy Site
Here we have tools to help you draft the perfect team in madden!

# Draft Hub
Enter your pick and we will give you suggestions around that pick. There is a watchlist so you don't miss out on the players you want.

# Rankings
We have a filterable list of rankings. This is an easy way to see what CBs go in round 6.

# Draft Entry
This is for the community members who want to make the data more accurate. You can enter in draft picks from a simulated draft.
